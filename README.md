# Toast-It JS
A very simple toast message for the web.

## How to use it
You just download and refer into your <head> </head> HTML file the toastitv1.0-min.css and toastitv1.0-min.js files.

After that, you should integrar in your JS project code files the following sintax:




```javascript
ToastIt.now({
            close: true, 
            style: 'success', 
            timer: 3700, 
            message: 'This is a toast message.' 
        }
)
```
