Here you have the [Toast-It Website](https://mobilepadawan.github.io/toastit-js/) for watching me in action. üëÄ

## How to use it
Download the minified version of `toastitv1.0-min.css` and `toastitv1.0-min.js` files and add them into your Web Project using the following sintax:

### CSS configuration
1. Add the CSS file in the `<head>` metatag in every HTML document where you need to use Toast-It.

```HTML
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="../path/to/css/library/toastitv1.0-min.css">
```
Or you can also import it into your primary CSS file.

```CSS
/* e.g. if you are using a CSS file called `styles.css`, 
   add the following link at the top of you CSS file. */

   @import url("../path/to/css/library/toastitv1.0-min.css");
```

### JS configuration
2. Add to the top of your JS main file the `import` statement to import the Toast-It JS file. üîù 
   
```javascript
import ToastIt from "../path/to/js/library/toastitv1.0-min.js";
```

3. Just configure the four basic parameters to start using Toasti-It. ‚öôÔ∏è
   
```javascript
ToastIt.now({
            close: true,            // true || false
            style: 'success',       // generic, info, success, warning, error
            timer: 3700,            //max: 10000
            message: `I'm a Toast-It message.` 
        }
)
```

These parameters must be added as an object parameter, into the parenthesis of the `.now()` method.

4. Your webapp is ready to enjoy this simple but effective library. ü•Ç
   1. Your main JS file and/or the JS files where you'll reference Toast-It JS must be declared as `type="module"`.
   2. We can't use this JS library as a CDN, yet. In the upcoming version we'll add this optional feature.

## Toast-It in action

You have an example to show how Toast-It runs in a desktop webapp.

And here is another example about Toast-It running in mobile screens. 
PS: _Please, be consistency with the length of toast messages to show._
