## How to use it
Download the minified version of `toastitv1.0-min.css` and `toastitv1.0-min.js` files and add them into your Web Project using the following sintax:

### CSS configuration
1. Add the CSS file in the `<head>` metatag in every HTML document where you need to use Toast-It.

```HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/toastitv1.0.min.css">
```
Or you can also import it into your primary CSS file by importing the toastitv1.0 CSS file via CSS `@import`.

```CSS
@import url("./css/toastitv1.0.min.css");
```

### JS configuration
2. Add to the top of your JS main file the `import` statement for importing the Toast-It JS file. üîù 
   
```javascript
import ToastIt from "./js/toastitv1.0.min.js";
```

3. Just configure the onlny four basic parameters to start using Toasti-It. ‚öôÔ∏è
   
```javascript
ToastIt.now({
            close: true,            // true || false
            style: 'success',       // generic, info, success, warning, error
            timer: 3700,            //max: 10000
            message: `I'm a Toast-It message.` 
        }
)
```

These parameters must be added using a literal object structure into the parenthesis of the `.now()` method.

4. Your webapp is ready to enjoy this simple but effective library.
   1. The main main JS file(s) where you declare `Toast-It JS` must be declared as `type="module"`.
   2. We can't use this JS library as a CDN, yet. In the upcoming version we'll add this optional feature.

### CDN alternative
If you prefer to use the CDN version of `Toastit-JS`, please download the minified version of `toastitv1.0-cdn.js` or the minified version of it. 

Remember to declare it in your JS code before the main JS file of your project.

```HTML
<head>
   <script src="./js/toastitv1.0-cdn.min.js"></script>
   <script defer src="./js/main.js"></script>
</head>
```

The CSS file is the same for both JS libraries.

## Toast-It in action

Watch the following example where you can show how Toast-It runs in a desktop webapp.

### First final version (üìÜ April 2024)
We have launched the final version of `ToastIt JS module` and `ToastIt JS CDN` the first week of April 2024.  The current final version is the `1.0`.

### Beta version (work in progress)
In this beta version `1.1` we are including the posibility to configure a `right`, `center` or `left` position for the Toast message on screen. 
Stay tuned for more information.

```javascript 
ToastIt.now({
            close: true,               // true || false
            style: 'success',          // generic, info, success, warning, error
            timer: 3700,               //max: 10000
            position: 'right',         // left, center, or right 
            message: `I'm a Toast-It message.`
        }
)
```

The current beta version is fully functional but only as a Module Library. If you want to try, don't forget to also download the CSS file. The filename we are working on is `toastitv1.1-beta.js` located at the developers folder.

ü§öüèº Please do not use this version **in Production!**!
